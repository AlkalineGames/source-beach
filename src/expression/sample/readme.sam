The files in this directory are samples of programs I have written
to use the SPLASH class library.

		  and also the win.ini file. It replaces all
		  non-truetype fonts with a user entered one

		  generated by Procomm/win for Compuserve logins

tstio.cpp	- Simple minded test of streams use with SPLASH

justify.cpp	- A filter program that justifies text to a given
		  line width

xcl.cpp		- A program that is used with the Tracer files that
		  automatically inserts a TRACER macro at the start
		  of all functions in a cpp program.

tstiter.cpp	- test the iteration class in SPListIter

setini.cpp	- A program that manipulates a windows .ini file
